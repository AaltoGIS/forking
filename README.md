# Forking exercise

## Basic workflow for collaborative programming

In the forking workflow, one repository is the “central” repository but people push to forks, i.e. their own copies of the repository on GitHub (or Gitlab which is another popular platform).

The good things about forking:

- Anybody can contribute without asking for permission (to public projects).
- Maintainer still has full control over what is merged.
- There is now more than one remote to work with.
